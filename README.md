This Visual Studio project assumes that you have a directory called "ThirdPartyLibraries" above the directory containing the project. In ThirdPartyLibraries, you should have installed GLFW, STB, and GLM. Additionally, at the same level as ThirdPartyLibraries, you should have installed the Vulkan SDK.

Alternatively, you can download the release zip file and run the program without building. 

Please let me know if you run into any issues.
